## Overview

This module will configure winbind for joining Active Directory and is designed
with hiera in mind. It will also, optionally, allow you to configure SMB shares
since `smb.conf` is used for both purposes.


## Setup Requirements

The configuration used in this module requires Samba >= 3.6.


## Beginning with winbind

### Usage

This module DOES NOT join your machine to AD. This is because I have not found
a secure way to do the joins since they require a privileged account and its
password. Once you have run this module at least once you can join your domain
by executing the following pair of commands:

```bash
# On Red Hat
net ads join -U yourADuserName
authconfig --enablemkhomedir --enablewinbind --enablewinbindauth --update

# on Suse
pam-config --add --winbind --mkhomedir --mkhomedir-umask=0077
net ads join -U yourADuserName
```

#### Example of a Puppet profile to configure winbind

1. Create a profile similar to:

  ```puppet
  # baseline stuff
  class profiles::base {
    # Used on selected OS only
    case $::kernel {
      Linux   : {
        include ::winbind

        $joindomain = $::osfamily ? {
          'RedHat' => 'joindomainForRedHat.sh',
          'Suse'   => 'joinDomainForSUSE.sh',
          default  => 'joindomainForRedHat.sh',
        }

        file { '/root/joinDomain.sh':
          ensure => present,
          mode   => '0755',
          source => "puppet:///modules/profiles/${joindomain}",
        }

      } # end Linux

      Windows : {
      }

      default : {
        fail("${::operatingsystem} is not supported.")
      }

    } # end case $::kernel
  }
  ```

2. Add the following default config values to hiera:

  ```yaml
  winbind::pam_require_membership_of :
    - 'sysadmins'
    - 'iso-scans'
  winbind::smb_realm                 : 'AD.EXAMPLE.COM'
  winbind::smb_workgroup             : 'AD'
  ```

3. Create a script to be copied by the profile created in step 1:

   The script must be platform specific. Below is an example of a script that is usable on the RedHat osfamily.

  ```bash
    ### This file is auto generated by Puppet ###
    ### Manual changes will be overwritten    ###

    #!/bin/bash

    username=$1

    if [ "$#" -ne 1 ]; then
       echo "Usage: $0 username"
       echo "Replace username with an account that can join this machine to the domain"
       exit 1
    fi

    # join domain with the name provided
    net ads join -U $username
    authconfig --enablemkhomedir --enablewinbind --enablewinbindauth --update
  ```

4. Apply the profile to desired nodes.

5. Run `puppet agent -t`.

6. Join domain using the script in root's home directory.

7. Rerun `puppet agent -t`.

8. Enjoy.

#### Configuring SMB shares

The settings above will get you on a domain. If you want to supplement those
with one or more SMB shares you will need the following additional configuration
settings:

1. Add `winbind::enable_sharing : true` to your node's file in hiera
2. Create a share by either placing files with the needed settings in
   `/etc/samba/smb.conf.d/` OR by using a hash. Using a hash is the recommended
   method.

   If you choose to use files, their names will need to be listed in an array
   as part of `winbind::smb_includes_files`

   If you choose to use a hash, you can either put it in a manifest like so:

   ```puppet
   $my_smb_settings_hash = {
     'share1' => {
       'path'      => '/tmp',
       'browsable' => 'yes',
       'read only' => 'yes'
     },
     'share2' => {
       'path'      => '/mnt',
       'browsable' => 'no',
       'read only' => 'yes'
     },
   }

   class { winbind:
     enable_sharing    => true,
     smb_settings_hash => $my_smb_settings_hash,
   }
   ```

   Or if you choose to use hiera the same hash would look like this:

   ```yaml
   ---
   winbind::smb_settings_hash:
     share1:
       path      : '/tmp'
       browsable : 'yes'
       read only : 'yes'
     share2:
       path      : '/mnt'
       browsable : 'no'
       read only : 'yes'
   ```

### Parameters

There is a parameter that corresponds directly to each setting in the four
configuration files that get edited by this module. Each is prefixed
so that you know which file it effects:

* pam     = /etc/security/pam_winbind.con
* smb     = /etc/samba/smb.conf
* krb5    = /etc/krb5.conf
* oddjobd = /etc/oddjobd.conf.d/oddjobd-mkhomedir.conf

The full list of parameters is listed at the top of the [`init.pp`][init.pp] file.
A fully functional setup should be attainable by providing values for the
following three parameters:

`pam_require_membership_of`

If set, this will limit who can log in via winbind

`smb_workgroup`

This is the short name of your domain.

`smb_realm`

This is the long name of your domain. It is also used in krb5.conf for the
`realms` and `domain_realms` settings.

#### Additional Parameters

`manage_messagebus_service`

Allows disabling the management of the messagebus service. Defaults to `true`.

`manage_oddjob_service`

Allows disabling the management of the oddjobd service. Defaults to `true`.

`package_ensure`

Defines the ensure setting passed to all managed packages. Defaults to `present`.


## Limitations

This module has only been tested on Red Hat 5, CentOS 6 & 7, and SLES 11 & 12.


## Troubleshooting

On RHEL 5 I found that joining was difficult if just the right things were not
in `/etc/hosts`. In particular, I got errors that my DNS name had to match the
domain I was joining. I resolved this issue by making a host entry like this:

```bash
# this should all be on a single line
127.0.0.1 server.example.com server.ad.example.com server localhost
localhost.localdomain  localhost4 localhost4.localdomain4

```

This entry is maintained via a host resource defined elsewhere in my Puppet setup.
